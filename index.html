        The concept of a strong nation is possible by moulding the personality of the students. To achieve this goal along with Literacy, we have to cultivate high moral values in our students like good conduct, morality, decency, the knowledge of Indian culture, high ideals, the feeling of self respect, courage, mercy, self-dependence, sincerity towards hard work; They should be aware of water harvesting, environment conservation and national problems like Terrorism and corruption.
        
        Being encouraged by these thoughts for the promotion and extension of restraints and society adaptable education, Bramhavarta Sanatan Dharma Mahamandal was founded in 1810, Governed by Bramhavarta Sanatana Dharma Mahamandal VSSD PG College, Law college, Pt.Deen Dayal Upadhyay Education Centre, BNSD Inter College, Sanatan Dharma Vidyalaya, BNSD Shiksha Niketan Balika Vidyalaya, Sri Motilal Khedia Sanatan Dharma Inter College, Durgawati Durga Prasad Sanatan Dharma Balika Vidyalaya and Smt.

        <p>It is the holy plan of Nature that we evolve holistically. Keeping this basic principle of Nature in mind, we at B.N.S.D. SHIKSHA NIKETAN, KANPUR, put in concerted efforts to facilitate the holistic growth of our students.

            Our jaid Niketan has been working since 1983 and trying its best to create best talents in every area by giving equal opportunity not only in the field of academic excellence but in various areas also i.e. cultural activities, Sports, Physical and Health Education and trying to bring out hidden talents who are excellent and can do the best. In these years B. N. S. D. Shiksha Niketan has proved its vision and mission that can be seen through the outcomes in nearly every field. Our stakeholders are well planned for their academic excellence and success in various areas. The glorified, achieved medals and cups are the landmarking examples of success by our students. We are fostering our children and preparing them in such a manner that will easily face the coming challenges of life. We are educating them not to come only with problems but with a proper solution also. We, the school, are preparing our young minds to be curious and interested to apply three words i.e. Think, Act, and Hope. For these particular ideals of life, we should try to become very particular in our life as it is well said- “Action without thought and thought without action are folly.”
            
            I am sure that their focused and collective endeavours will bear fruit. I wish all the best to my very dear students and the team members, who work unflinchingly for a mission.</p></center>
